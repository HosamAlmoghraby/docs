This tutorial will show you how to develop an application using Okteto Stacks.
[Okteto Stacks](/docs/reference/stacks/) are for developers who don't want to deal with the complexities of Kubernetes manifests.
Okteto Stacks implement and extend the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec) to make it easy to deploy containers in Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Okteto CLI. Follow this [guide](/docs/cloud/okteto-cli/) if you haven't done it yet.
- Configure Access to your Okteto Cloud Namespace [using the Okteto CLI](/docs/cloud/credentials/#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-using-the-okteto-cli) or [using the Okteto Cloud UI](/docs/cloud/credentials/#download-your-kubernetes-credentials-from-the-okteto-cloud-ui).

## Step 1: Deploy the Sample App

Get a local version of the Sample App by executing the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/compose-getting-started
$ cd compose-getting-started
```

The Sample App is a simple web application implemented using Python, with Redis for storage.
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the components of the Sample App:

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build: vote
    scale: 2
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - 6379
    volumes:
      - redis:/data

volumes:
  redis:
```

The equivalent Kubernetes manifests would have more than 300 lines of yaml!

Deploying the Sample App is as simple as executing this command:

```console
$ okteto stack deploy --wait
```

```console
 âœ“  Deployed service 'vote'
 âœ“  Deployed service 'redis'
 âœ“  Stack 'compose-getting-started' successfully deployed
```

The `deploy` command will create the necessary deployments, services, persistent volumes, and ingress rules needed to run the Sample App.  Cool no ðŸ˜Ž?

Open your browser and go to the URL of the application. You can get the URL by logging into [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/?origin=docs) and clicking on the application's endpoint:

## Step 2: Developing time!

Let's make some changes to our application. For example, open the `vote/app.py` file in your IDE and modify the voting options on lines 16-17. Save your changes.

```python
def getOptions():
    option_a = "Local development"
    option_b = "Cloud development"
```

Once you're happy with your changes, execute the following command:

```console
$ okteto stack deploy --build
```

```console
i  Running your build in tcp://buildkit.cloud.okteto.net:1234...
i  Building image for service 'vote'...

`okteto stack deploy --build` automatically builds a new image tag using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/cloud/build/), pushes it to the [Okteto Registry](/docs/cloud/registry/), and redeploys your application with the new image tag.
In a matter of seconds, your changes are running in the Cloud ðŸ’¥!
