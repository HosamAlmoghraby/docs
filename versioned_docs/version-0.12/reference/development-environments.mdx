One of the advantages of using Okteto is the ability to configure development environments as code, side by side with your application.

Instead of having to keep a wiki with a never-ending list of tools, dependencies, and scripts to install and run, you just have to clone your repository, deploy your application, and run `okteto up` to start developing in seconds.

## Before you get started

Setting up development environments using Okteto involves two main steps:

1. Deploying your application code
2. Using `okteto up` to start your development container

For using `okteto up`, you will need to install the Okteto CLI. Okteto CLI is an [open-source](https://github.com/okteto/okteto) tool that helps spin up development containers regardless of where you choose to deploy your application code as part of the first step. You can learn more about it by heading to the documentation [here](/docs/cloud/okteto-cli/). 

For the first step of deploying your application, there are multiple approaches for you to choose from. You can use Okteto for deploying your application. This way, you get a robust developer experience specially tailored by us, keeping Remote Development Environments in mind. Okteto comes with useful additional features you would not find in a traditional cluster.

With Okteto you can:

- Deploy your development environments with the [Okteto CLI](/docs/cloud/okteto-cli/) or from your [Git Repositories](/docs/cloud/deploy-from-git/).
- Configure [Secrets](/docs/cloud/secrets/) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control.
- Expose your development environments via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](/docs/cloud/ssl/) for your services, [Private Endpoints](/docs/cloud/private-endpoints/) to restrict access, and [Custom Domain Names](/docs/cloud/custom-domains/).
- Build your images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/cloud/build).
- Push your container images in the [Okteto Registry](/docs/cloud/registry).
- Create secure Kubernetes [Namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces/) with one click.
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](/docs/cloud/credentials/) to access your namespaces with `kubectl`, `helm`, or any other CLI tool.
- Visualize your workloads in a Developer-focused Kubernetes dashboard.

If you want to try it out, head to our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started/) and see how you can use Okteto to simplify developing cloud-native applications. 

With Okteto, you can also further choose between either hosting the infrastructure yourself or letting us take care of managing the cloud infrastructure for you. The former offers you full control of your Kubernetes infrastructure while delivering the same smooth experience you expect from Okteto. The Okteto Self-Hosted [documentation](/docs/enterprise) covers how you can get started with it. You can learn more about the exact differences from the [pricing page](https://www.okteto.com/pricing/).

Okteto CLI works out of the box with any Kubernetes cluster. This means that the other option available for you is to take care of creating a convenient developer experience around your dev environments yourself and then only relying on Okteto CLI to launch the Remote Development Environments. With this approach, you are also responsible for setting up and managing the Kubernetes cluster. This approach is completely independent of using the Okteto platform or any of its features. 

## Getting started

At a high level, a development container is a Docker container that contains:

- One or more language runtimes (e.g python, ruby, node)
- SDKs for your language runtime (e.g JDK, python-dev)
- Binary dependencies (e.g. openssl, git)
- Tools to manage and install dependencies (e.g. pip, bundler, yarn)
- Tools to run your tests and analyze your code (e.g nosetest, pylint)
- Your source code

When you run the `okteto init` command on a local repository, `okteto` will analyze your source code and will guess the main programming language you're using.
Based on this, it will select a base development container configuration and create a default `okteto.yml` for you.

For example, if your repository is mostly `golang`, it will look like this:

```yaml
dev:
  my-app:
    image: golang:alpine
    volumes:
      - /go/pkg/
      - /root/.cache/go-build/
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
```

Out of the box, Okteto maintains pre-configured development images in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/okteto/devenv) for the following languages:

- dotnetcore
- golang
- java
- node
- php
- python
- ruby
- rust

## Create your own

The default development images are a great way to start.
They use the latest official docker image for your language runtime and include the most common developer tools and a custom bash prompt.
But they might not have everything you need. Your team might need to support a very specific version of your runtime, or you might need some extra tooling available.

Do the following to create your own development image:

1. Create a Dockerfile
1. Pick a base image
1. Add your extra dependencies, tools, and files
1. Build your image, tag it, and push it to your docker registry
1. Update the `image` key in your `okteto.yml` with your new image

Besides following [Docker's best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/), we also recommend the following:

- Create the docker image in CI, so it's clear how and when it was built
- Pin all your dependencies, so there aren't any surprises
- Keep the Dockerfile in your repository, next to your code
- When using [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), use your development image as the builder stage, so that you have the same tools and images in dev than in CI/CD
