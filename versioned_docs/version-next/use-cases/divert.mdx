Wouldn’t it be nice if you could have multiple versions of your app available to test when you’re trying to determine which way to go with a new feature or determining how to fix a bug? 

Thanks to our new feature, [divert](https://okteto.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started-with-divert/), you can now have two simultaneously running versions of your app and just replace the piece of code that you want to test for each one. 
This helps in development, testing, and also for things like carrying out canary deployments. 
Have confidence in your solution when you can visualize multiple versions of your application at once.
