Okteto Enterprise is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of [Okteto Cloud](/docs/next/cloud/), with the control and flexibility of running in your Kubernetes infrastructure.

With Okteto Enterprise your team can:

- Deploy your development environments with the [Okteto CLI](/docs/next/getting-started/) or from your [Git Repositories](/docs/next/cloud/deploy-from-git/).
- Configure [Secrets](/docs/next/cloud/secrets/) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control.
- Expose your development environments via [Automatic HTTPs Endpoints](/docs/next/cloud/ssl/) for your services, [Private Endpoints](/docs/next/cloud/private-endpoints/) to restrict access, and [Custom Domain Names](/docs/next/cloud/custom-domains/).
- Build your images directly in the cloud using the [Okteto Build Service](/docs/next/cloud/build).
- Push your container images in the [Okteto Registry](/docs/next/cloud/registry).
- Create secure Kubernetes [Namespaces](/docs/next/cloud/namespaces/) with one click.
- Download your [Kubernetes Credentials](/docs/next/cloud/credentials/) to access your namespaces with `kubectl`, `helm`, or any other CLI tool.
- Collaborate by [sharing](/docs/next/cloud/namespaces/#share-your-namespace) your namespaces with your teammates
- Keep your infrastructure under control with the Okteto [Garbage Collector](/docs/next/enterprise/administration/cleanup/) and the [Okteto Autoscaler](/docs/next/enterprise/administration/configuration/#autoscaler)
