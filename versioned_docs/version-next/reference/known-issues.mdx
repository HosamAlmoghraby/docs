## Development environments do not hot-reload code changes

If you are using a hot reloader in your development environment, it might happen that your hot reloader does not pick the code changes even when they are properly synchronized to your development environment.

This is usually because the default *max watchers* value on your Kubernetes nodes is too low. To fix this issue, update the value of `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` in all your Kubernetes nodes (we recommend the value `10048576`).

For example, you can do it by running this command on each node:

```console
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=10048576
```

Okteto Cloud and Okteto Enterprise use a Daemon Set to apply this change automatically to every Kubernetes node.

## *kubectl apply* changes are undone by *okteto up*

> This only applies to Okteto CLI 1.14.1 and older.

If you need to apply changes to your Kubernetes Deployment Manifest after running `okteto up`, note that **you need to run `okteto down` first** or `okteto up` will undo the changes you do to your Kubernetes Deployment Manifests. The reason is that `okteto up` records a copy of the deployment when `okteto up` is executed. This copy is used by `okteto down` to restore the original Kubernetes Deployment Manifest. But it is also used by `okteto up` as the original deployment to avoid ambiguities of "kubectl apply" concurrent changes.

This issue does not apply if you're using Okteto Cloud or Okteto Enterprise since the `okteto up` translation is done by a Mutation Webhook and there is no need to restore the original definition of the Kubernetes Deployment Manifest on `okteto down`.

## The okteto prompt doesn't look right in Windows

Okteto's remote prompt uses [ANSI escape sequences](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-windows-console-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update/) to display the namespace and development environment name in different colors. 

If you're using PowerShell and the terminal looks funky, this feature might not enabled. Run the command below to enable ANSI Color globally:

```console
Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\Console VirtualTerminalLevel -Type DWORD 1
```
